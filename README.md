### README.md


### License
It is recommended that an MIT license is added to every repository. Although we wonâ€™t be sharing all code publicly, this at least ensures consistency across all repositories.

### .gitignore files
To ensure that certain file types are not automatically synchronised with a repository, [create a .gitignore file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) within each repository. For a basic .gitignore file that should suit most repositories, use the contents maintained here: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/octocat/9257657/raw/3f9569e65df83a7b328b39a091f0ce9c6efc6429/.gitignore
