# User guide for GitHub
This is a resource for information about using GitHub within Insentra, useful links for learning about GitHub and recommended tools. This guide is not intended to be a complete user guide but will contain useful information on getting up and running quickly for anyone new to Git and GitHub.

## About GitHub
Most of our usage within Insentra is likely to be PowerShell related usage as most of us IT Pros; however, additional usage will include repositories hosting Visual Studio code and SQL queries.

Be sure to read the [Insentra usage policy](https://github.com/Insentra/usage-policy) for GitHub.

### Creating a New Repository
When creating a new repository, the following selections are recommended:
* Repository name - choose a descriptive yet simplified name
* Description - add a short description of the repository
* Public / Private - the repository will be private by default
* Initialise this repository with a README - this will make it simple to provide some details as to what the repository is for
* Add .gitignore - choose an ignore template that matches the project, or close to it. The contents can be changed later
* Add a license - choose the MIT license by default

### README.md
Initialise each repository with a README.md that includes some information about the code stored in the repository. If the repository is for a specific project, including the project number in the readme will assist with tracking.

### License
It is recommended that an MIT license is added to every repository. Although we wonâ€™t be sharing all code publicly, this at least ensures consistency across all repositories.

### .gitignore files
To ensure that certain file types are not automatically synchronised with a repository, [create a .gitignore file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) within each repository.

A basic .gitignore file that should suit most repositories, can be found here: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/octocat/9257657/raw/3f9569e65df83a7b328b39a091f0ce9c6efc6429/.gitignore

For additional customisation, see [the gitignore.io site](https://www.gitignore.io/) that contains templates for a large number of languages.
